Budget, schedule, scope, work/life balance; you're forced to cut a corner here and there and the vision of perfection slips further and further away until the end result is fragile, fetid shell of your original idea. How can we deal with inevitable compromises while maintaining our integrity as engineers (and pride in our work)",

Our applications need to respond to user interactions such as mouse movements, clicks and inputs as well as asynchronous inputs like XHR calls, server sent events, setInterval, even web socket events! Unfortunately as things stand today, there is no *consistent* way to deal with the myriad of different \"changes\" that could happen in an application. \n\nBut what if there is? This is what Reactive Extensions (specifially RxJs in this session) allow us to do. It offers us an abstraction that allows us to treat everything from DOM events (infinite streams) to our domain (`map`s, `set`s and `array`s) as *streams*. This **consistent** interface now permits us to create and manipulate any source identically. Futhermore, it allows us to react to  *different* sources as if they are one! \n\nReactive Extensions are fast becoming the de-facto approach of managing asynchronicity in JS land. From Netflix's UI to Angular 2 `$http` to ES7 - reactive programming is everywhere!",
    "detail":"This session is RxJs 101, covering\n\n- A brief introduction to reactive programming\n- How reactive programming is analogous to dataflow programming\n- The architectural patterns underlying reactive extensions\n- How we can create and manipulate \"observable\" streams within our applications\n- Error handling\n- Hot and Cold observables\n- The reactive landscape, and a couple of gotcha\n\nIf we have time we will look at a simple demo, and reactive progamming's role in Angular 2",
